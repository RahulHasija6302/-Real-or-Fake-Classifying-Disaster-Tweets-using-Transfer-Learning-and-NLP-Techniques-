Project Title: "Classifying Disaster Tweets using Transfer Learning"

Problem Description: The aim of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify disaster tweets as either real or fake. However, rather than building a model from scratch, we will use transfer learning to leverage the power of pre-trained language models such as BERT or GPT-2.

Data Description: The dataset we will use is the "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets" dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains 7,613 training samples and 3,263 test samples, each consisting of a tweet and a binary label (0 for fake, 1 for real).

Analysis Steps:

Load and preprocess the data: Load the dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as cleaning, tokenization, and normalization.

Fine-tune a pre-trained language model: Use transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained language model such as BERT or GPT-2 on the disaster tweets dataset. This involves training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance on the validation set.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Interpret the results: Analyze the results of the model and identify any patterns or insights that can be gained from it.

Conclusion: Summarize the findings of the project and discuss their implications. Reflect on what you learned from this mini-project and any limitations or challenges you encountered. Finally, suggest future directions for research on this topic.
